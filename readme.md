# SQL Practice

This project practices putting together various sql data modeling designs, to think through problems around 1:1, 1:many and many:many relationships.

Note: These systems were challenges as a part of *Modeling 101* by Lucas Felix Carvalho.

1. Project Management System Design: A data model to create a simplified system similar to Jira or Asana.

2. Streaming Platform System Design: A data model to create a system similar to Hulu, HBOMax or Netflix.
